### My first project, [an analysis of npr episode titles](https://github.com/katchia/side-projects/tree/main/npr_text_analysis):

It took me a couple of weeks of attempting Tidy Tuesdays until I felt confident enough to share a post. Unfortunately, my debut into data viz was -not- a Tidy Tuesday dataset, but rather one I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

I spent a lot of time reading [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) and [David Robinson's](https://twitter.com/drob) [Text Mining in R: A Tidy Approach](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html) and wanted to apply some basic functions for my first project. 

I remember being really proud of this plot, so thanks for looking!
