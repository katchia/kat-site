### Tidy Tuesday (Week 22), [speed runnin' Mario Kart](https://github.com/katchia/side-projects/tree/main/mario_kart/mario_kart):

My first Tidy Tuesday contribution! An examination of Mario Kart speed runners. I think part of the reason I held off for so long from contributing to [Tidy Tuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=typed_query) was because I wanted to submit something substantial. I used `ggdark`, `patchwork`, and `extrafont` for this project! 

Using `patchwork` for the first time made me feel super powerful, so this project is a milestone for me. Thanks for looking!
