### A look at Dogecoin, [the most hilariously volatile stock](https://github.com/katchia/side-projects/tree/main/doge):
![rise and fall](https://github.com/katchia/side-projects/blob/main/doge/rise_fall.png?raw=true)

Man, oh man. [Dogecoin](https://dogecoin.com/) was quite the whirlwind when I created this. I wanted to make something with a timeseries component, so I decided to try a stock out. Could I have picked a stable one like Apple? Sure, but that plot would have been quite monotonous, and frankly, I had seen some people employ **arrows** in their plots, and was feeling some FOMO. 

I settled on Dogecoin due to its volatile nature and interesting pop-culture time stamps (such as the dip in value when Elon Musk appeared on SNL).

Thanks for looking!
