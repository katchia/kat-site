## Trying out `gt` and `gtExtras` with some soccer data. [FIFA World Cup Winners](https://github.com/katchia/side-projects/tree/main/fifa%20gt%20table):

I grew up playing and watching soccer. My favorite summers were World Cup summers, because it meant I could watch hours on hours of the sport. Subsequently, the FIFA World Cup dataset from Kaggle felt like an appropriate source for testing out this new package by [Tom Mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock)!

Next step: figure out how to embed flags into their own column?
