**Hi, I'm Kat.**

I'm a PhD Candidate in Cognitive Psychology @ [Florida State University](https://psy.fsu.edu/) and I work with the unparalleled [Dr. Michael Kaschak](https://psy.fsu.edu/php/people/people.php?_tr=1_5#), investigating linguistic alignment and language production.

Currently, I am a Research Lead and Data Scientist at the Language, Learning, and Memory lab at Florida State University. I am also leading an "R for Data Science" course for my lab.

I will be starting a new role as a Research Scientist at [Cangrade](https://www.cangrade.com/), AI start-up, this summer.

This website was made using the `distill` and `postcards` packages in R. It is currently being hosted on **Github** and **Netlify**.


Feel free to poke around and reach out at any of the below links.
