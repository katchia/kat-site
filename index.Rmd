**Hi, I'm Kat.**

I have my PhD in Cognitive Psychology from [Florida State University](https://psy.fsu.edu/), where I worked with the unparalleled [Dr. Michael Kaschak](https://psy.fsu.edu/php/people/people.php?_tr=1_5#), investigating linguistic alignment and language production.

During my Ph.D. program, I was a Research Lead and Data Scientist at the Language, Learning, and Memory lab at Florida State University. I also led an "R for Data Science" course for my lab.

I'm currently a Research Scientist at the AI start-up, [Cangrade](https://www.cangrade.com/). My role here is dynamic, as I build predictive models using machine learning to estimate candidate success in roles, refine organization-wide psychometric and analytical approaches, design and execute internal and external research projects, and advocate for Responsible AI.

This website was made using the `distill` and `postcards` packages in R. It is currently being hosted on **Github** and **Netlify**.


Feel free to poke around and reach out at any of the below links.
